With a population exceeding 20 million, the city grapples with mountains of waste, with single-use plastics forming a significant chunk. These non-biodegradable materials clog drainage systems, leading to floods, litter streets, and contaminate waterways, harming ecosystems and wildlife. Styrofoam, notorious for its long lifespan and resistance to natural breakdown, poses a particularly severe threat."
