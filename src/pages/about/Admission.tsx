              basic sciences of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology; the
              Basic Engineering Courses of Engineering drawing and Workshop

              Engineering), in the Rain Semester. The remaining 2nd-year courses
              are the Common School of Engineering Courses taken through the
              formal University lectures, tutorials, practicals, assignments and
              examination, followed by a 3-months industrial attachment period
              during the long vacation (SIW 200). Thereafter, an Industrial

              assignments and examinations, followed by a 3-months industrial

              an Industrial Training (IT) report is submitted and defended by

              months industrial attachment period follows in the second semester
              (SIW400). This is also followed by a 2-months industrial
              attachment during the long vacation period (SIW400/401).
              Therefore, a combined Industrial Training report (SIW 400/401) is
              submitted and defended by each student and graded. One common
              engineering course ENG 405 is also taken in the Harmattan
